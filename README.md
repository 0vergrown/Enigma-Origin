# ðŸŽ­ Enigma Origin ðŸŽ­

**This Pack Adds:**
- Custom Origin

**Origin Detail:**

**Icon**: Jigsaw\
**Impact**: ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡\
**Description**: You are the embodiment of mystery and deception. Your presence instills fear and uncertainty, making others question the very fabric of their reality. The world around you is but a puzzle, and you, the unsolvable riddle within it.

*Positive* ðŸŸ¢:
- **Shadow's Embrace**: With the shadows as your ally, you can appear behind anyone, unseen and unheard. (Primary)
- **Illusory Doppelganger**: Summon a deceptive clone in your stead as you meld into invisibility. An explosion of dark energy ensues if either of you is struck, revealing your form and annihilating the clone. Voluntarily dispel the clone with a mere thought. (Secondary)
- **Ephemeral Phantom**: Embrace the shadows, becoming intangible and nearly invisible. Phase through the very matter of the world, leaving no trace but a chilling breeze. (Load Toolbar Activator)
- **Gaze of the Abyss**: Lock eyes with your prey and let the dance of doom commence. Initially, your victims are slowed and weakened, but as the dance progresses, they are blinded and overwhelmed by nausea, until the abyss consumes them. (Save Toolbar Activator)
- **Midnight Sight**: Within the veiled cloak of darkness, the Enigma sees clearly.

*Negative* ðŸ”´:
- **Aura of Mistrust**: The air around you whisper tales of betrayal. Villagers refuse to barter, and the creatures of the land deny your companionship.
- **Ephemeral Existence**: Your mysterious nature makes you more susceptible to damage, as your form flickers between reality and illusion
